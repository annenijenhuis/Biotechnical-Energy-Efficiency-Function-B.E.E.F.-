This is a text file that includes the inputs of the dummy data that are needed to run the model.
The user must copy the values from the files themselves and input it into the model.

Input question:
A CSV file with a matrix of the temperature (°C), plotted against the incubation time of the full degradation (days): 
Answer: This file is provided in the Dummy_Data folder.

Input question:
Particle size of the polyethylene (mm³) in the water while performing the tests for temperature: 
Answer: 25
